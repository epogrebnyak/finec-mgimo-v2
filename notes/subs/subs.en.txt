good afternoon, dear listeners, colleagues,
friends, I am the dean of the faculty of financial economics pogrebnyak evgeny
, today I represent my colleagues, the authors of the digital
finn program of the digital finance master's program,
which for the first time this year is presented at our faculty,
a very rich program is dedicated to three vectors of development of
finance and companies in this sector  finn tech this is digital transformation
changing the financial function changing how the finance
department and treasury work planning and economic departments in
corporations, this third direction seems to me the
most under-researched or not fully disclosed and very important because these

00:01
changes in the finances of an enterprise
occur in  for all companies, it doesn’t matter if this is the
financial sector or other sectors of the economy, and based on the relevance of
this task for the digital finance sector, we organized our current
round table, which is dedicated to the profession of a
digital financial director digital sifu and today we want to learn from
practitioners about the relevance of this task in
different industries in different combos in different industries in
different companies in different types of business how the
profession of financial director is changing is there really a new
digital component this is our first question how it is seen from different
companies and the second is  how can we better organize the training of students
so that they can better fit into the new reality

00:02
and become such agents of change in enterprises so that they already come with
some new skills that are in demand in companies and their career, their
professional growth would be  thanks to this, even more quickly,


I would like to give the floor to our foreign guest,
our friend john kibby housing gianluca na financier by education engineer by
other education worked in the telecommunications sector in private
investment funds in italy and the middle east and is the founder of a start-up
in the field of financial in addition to this,
Gianluca is actively consulting now, I would

00:03
like to ask him about the existence of such a profession, does digital exist?

00:11
in excel and never heard of writing problems  Gianluca from and about
it hides models and runaways and excel here using excel at my life of a
brief solved the models of the model our next speech from our
colleagues from the nikon auditing company and he is
Larisa Efremova Olga  Chumachenko, and in preparation for this speech, it
sounded very important and very important for me that the
need to digitalize the financial function is never at all, yes, it’s
not not not yesterday not tomorrow, but it is in 2022 that a

00:12
very interesting case will be happy to listen to you well now by connecting
colleagues, it’s nice to hear everyone, it’s a pity that we
don’t really see everyone. 2022 has
become a very important digitalization system for us for Russia,
which is connected with federal law
125a in the Russian Federation on January 1, 22; accounting for rent, this
standard was prepared on the basis of f-16  that
is, for the first time in Russia, in order to reflect
some operations on financial and operating leases, they cannot
simply be taken from someone’s contract from some invoice invoice,

00:13
etc., but it will be necessary to make calculations for exactly what we need
digitalization for now we are on  example,
we will show what calculations will need to be done and the second moment
for the first time in Russia  But in our
Russian standard, emphasis is placed on the mandatory use in Russia of the
international standard for calculating reserves for expected
credit losses, this is mc under 9, directly
in the victory standard itself, this is indicated
if earlier registered with the lessor if the accounting is based on the
balance sheet of the lessor, then this is a fixed
asset  a profitable investment is reflected in
income in the form of just for the flesh,
there are no problems if the ball on the balance sheet of the
lessee then reflects interest and the total cost of all lease
payments is reflected in the same way on the
balance sheet, then from January 1, 22

00:14
, everything has changed dramatically, what is happening now in accordance with
25 we must the moment at the earliest date to
qualify the contract is it a financial lease or operating paying attention
specifically to the lessor there are certain functions the
principles of financial rent I will literally list a few others you
will see there in the presentation, first of all, if
at the end of the lease contract the right to
own  responsibility for the leased property passes to the
lessee this is a financial tape the second moment if the tenant has the right
to purchase the leased asset at the end of the
contract at a cost much lower than the
market value this is also a financial lease if the lease term
takes up a significant part of the period of

00:15
use of the equipment then this is also a financial lease here in IFRS and  in
Russian legislation, the word is significant, and if we turn to and with
ready-made standards, then more than 75 percent are written there, we will also
adhere to this if it is necessary to conclude an agreement when we press about
discounting cash flows, we will see that the discounting cost
is practically equal to the cost where the market
object of lease  this is also a financial
tape, practically this is again all with us
or zentsov or from Russia Gamovskoe's views are
written more than 90 percent well, and the tenant has the
right to extend the contract at a cost much lower than
if he had simply accepted this contract zero and this subject l  I just
bought leasing and that it comes from tires for the first time
we understand the concept of such discounting of cash flows the

00:16
effective rate was not previously in Russian standards and this is only
true with the help of anti-technologies when we determined that this
financial lease from the lessor is reflected in the balance sheet as  net
investment in rent and income is in the
form of interest if these indicators are not met, the signs that you list,
then this is an operating lease and income is recognized evenly over the entire
lease term, but the cost of all all lease payments and here we are
returning the same value of net investment in rent yes  we have a
gross investment that includes all leasing flows,
plus for the first time again in Russian legislation there is a non-guaranteed
liquidation value, this is the cost at which we can
sell the leased asset at the end
of the lease agreement, for example, at the end of the

00:17
agreement, the cost of a truck will be cost 100,000 why not guaranteed
yet unknown sell and or not we take the net gross investment
in the lease discounted at the effective rate and find the net investment in the
lease that is, the question arises what is a fictitious rate
what is discounting and what is cash flow and all this is done with
With the help of special programs , our requirements for the application of
encef 9 arise, we must definitely conduct a
test for the depreciation of net investments in
rent. This is a whole topic that is very interesting. simulate
what is the expected credit loss and will pay the client will not pay us when he
pays what amount what kind of losses

00:18
we will incur and so on there is a possibility of
bankruptcy or not and as a rule this is the
minimum you need to do a divorce but all companies do this at least quarterly
h  then it happens with the lessee the lessee’s o rn
it is very important no matter what operating or financial lease
there will always be the right to use the
assets and liabilities in the balance sheet where the
liabilities are not in vain it is 16 on the basis of
which facebook 25 was prepared in Europe was accepted for 10 years why
because  even if this operating lease,
as a rule, these were aircraft, then all the
same, the obligations had to be reflected, and
from this immediately all the cavenants for
obtaining credit funds from us, to put
it mildly, flew away from it, so for a very long time this

00:19
standard was adopted in just two words, I want to say it can be
excluded not to apply this standard here there are three cases when you can not
apply, but these cases, as a rule, they practically do not fit, because
now, even in Russian legislation, it happens when the economic form is over the
content , once very many years ago, ten years ago it was necessary to register a
special real estate lease agreement state bodies  and therefore, in order not to
register it, companies entered into an agreement for 11 months and extended it
for ten years, and now the companies also have to say
that it’s not the only one for months, I fall under
exceptions for it, the application of this
standard will not work, so you and I should see if  optional if
we can extend the rights or about after all and so

00:20
on under what conditions and anyway we accept the right to use the axioms
because the exception does not fit the second
moment the cost of the standard is reflected is
300 thousand I draw your attention to 300000 this should be the cost
initially these residuals with us  300
thousand and the cost, let's say an ATM, it
cost a million, that means the exception is also
not suitable, and if there is an exception on the simplified system
3, but here you also need to look if the
ownership of the property is transferred if it is subleased, the exception
cannot be applied, so we have come to the conclusion
that a large  part must apply for 25
and we are with you  we start with the fact that we
determine the obligations of the guy
with the contract and we don’t see it, take the
numbers ready from the invoice, we can’t we
have to calculate all this with you, that is, we must
determine at the sight of the present value of future foam, here

00:21
such a moment arises if this is a financial lease  there and the solution
is calculated very quickly, and if we allow the building
to use the building in our case, well,
let's say we took it for five years, and the building itself has
been used for 50 years, or there is 30
effective rate, as a rule, there is no effective rate in the
contract and no one orders you and also  cost must be calculated fair
.  that is, it’s also unrealistic for me to hire an appraiser so
that we can give examples here, you can apply the rate using the
statistical bulletin of the Bank of Russia, that is, under what conditions
is a loan issued for exactly these terms with such and such
requirements, and so on we apply this rate  we discount lease payments and
rent and find the lease obligations, we found the lease obligations,
well done, but you and I need to determine

00:22
all the rights to use the asset, and it
also adds, in addition to the lease obligation, the advance payments that you
paid earlier, the costs associated with the acquisition of the leased asset
, well  let's say we bought some kind of mill and we need to
bring it to a state in order to use
it, that is, the adjustment of this machine, the
estimated obligation to dismantle,
for example, the simplest example is a drilling rig we leased a parkour or a
well, we need to do the installation of this rig and that's just the
last moment  it's still to bring the recovery  The change in the environment
before you started this indicates that there is a formation,
first of all, of an obligation that is associated with discounting cash
flows and then the right to use assets and liabilities
lives their own lives separately because we extinguish obligations depending on

00:23
our lease payments, that is, the lease payment  is divided into two parts
, repayment of the principal debt and interest
that we will pay, and depreciation the right to use if the
ownership of this asset is transferred, then by the term of use if the
ownership is not transferred by the term of the contract, I want to focus your
attention on what is really with the input from this standard which  have
been waiting for a long time which really shows the economic essence of the
investment essence of the financial lease, this has led to the fact that
now many companies are installing various of these technologies in order
for these lease payments to be immediately calculated  but purely investments in
rent, that is, grain companies and for the right to use, first obligations,

00:24
then the right to use from other companies, and since
most of our country is still engaged in
renting, this standard is important for everyone
if there are any questions, I’m ready for
them  answer now or later in the chat, as you like,
aware of the wedding is a very interesting case
for the fact that which shows that before the digital endorse something in
finance, you need to understand how it works even before digitalization, what
Gianluca was talking about understands the meaning and
final value of what we are doing to me it seems a great illustration here is
our theses I know that olga has a presentation on how I will teach it
olga chumachenko is ready yes colleagues good
afternoon you know again I would like to start the presentation with the fact
that we have a great opportunity to show how

00:25
much the specialty that is now in demand will be it is
announced and dedicated to this specialty our master's program in
here is everything that we have heard now, seen in the presentation, in
fact, this is all being done, this is all being implemented,
including by young specialists who come to our company with knowledge of
finance, of course, she is very interested in specialists who
will have knowledge in order to then in practice  colleagues, tell me
please, I can show my presentation right now, the organizers are fine,
let's say straight out that we
have a common task, this is the answer to the question of

00:26
how we need and what to teach our young specialist what competencies are in
demand in this case in our company we are the largest logical Russian  company
let's talk about it [music] first, based on and relying on the
presentation of vladimir, of course, this is the ability to
conduct an analysis based on empirical means, this means that it is necessary
that a young specialist had deep knowledge of basic deep
knowledge of financial tax accounting master's  programs they include such
sections such courses but this is not enough because a developed soskin
with which is focused primarily on the development strategy of this company in
which you work and given the main trend associated with the
digitalization of financial departments,
what kind of knowledge, in our opinion, is most in
demand, of course, this is primarily

00:27
advanced  the level of knowledge is one s.a. you need to strive to ensure that
you have this knowledge you have two years to complete the training and
practically it is necessary because this is the main basic level for the work of
financial acquisition of course now there are such global changes in
accounting and you need to understand some reasons why these  treason
is being introduced, such pragmatics exist at the
current moment when implementing, of
course, we must understand that if there is a
cowardly specificity, that is, we expect that a specialist who comes to us could
clearly realize that those changes that
you take into account are taking place, they still
have industry specifics, do not forget the earth and we  we would recommend

00:28
just the same through the prism of what federal standards exist for very much
accounting Russian and international financial reporting standards
here are the issues of convergence where we are now what are our main problems
all this is very much in demand in many large companies in the audit
industry and of course  we expect from young professionals the
ability to conduct a qualitative analysis based on the obtained
financial indicators, that is, not only to understand what they
are, but also to understand that on their
basis it is possible to carry out very high-quality
financial accounting caught up with tax accounting of course tax accounting
financial accounting are closely interconnected and short  I will say that
you know financial accounting, so you need
to understand at least the basic basis for
tax accounting, it is very important to develop

00:29
yourself the so-called very popular large company sap skills, well, firstly,
you need to be able to work in a team, the basic principles and orpheus of
teamwork, what is focus, the result is
very important time is needed  to understand
when I would say so time management is the
basis for the development of a young specialist corporate culture the
concept of subordination, all these
seemingly important principles are generally understandable,
but they are important for an employer when he decides to
cooperate with a young  specialists as a young specialist to achieve the
required level of competence, but let's say straight out that we all
now live in an era of great change and only continuous acquisition of new
knowledge in order to improve professional chicks can be two

00:30
ways - self-education and let the area in exile which program helps to reach the
required level  then competencies knowledge of
excel knowledge of 1c, attention to the
relevance of the complex issues of introducing new Russian
accounting standards in the twentieth year, of course, you need
to understand the issues related to the introduction of new and IFRS
financial analysis and those issues that I considered in the owl skills section
on my part, I’ll probably be glad now  to answer questions if they have
colleagues, in

00:31
fact, continuous professional development gives us the opportunity through self-education advanced training courses to reach this level in order for us to have some kind of rapid introduction of
digitalization in the financial  division olives questions
quite a big thank you, it seems to me a very specific, clearly formulated
request for highly qualified employees and indeed this
adaptation understanding of subordination
understanding of how teams work in 1 of their corporate cultures really
only through practice we can instill we will be glad to develop cooperation with
you and by the way with  clients of your auditing company in order for our
students to take root there, thank you very much for marrying the speech, I want
to give the floor to Yulia Yanina, this is our
colleague, a teacher, a person who is already facing

00:32
our specific bachelor's my and master's programs, we have experience teaching
in the master's program  the economy go here Yulia asked him to share but
such practical considerations as Yulia looks to you but
digitalization seems to be based on your practical experience as a financial
professional and well, what can we give new to ours students
good afternoon everyone can’t hear yes yes harmless on this I loved yes
hello from the crimea if july can include a presentation because I have

00:33
a small technical problem here there was a blockage thanks I completely
agree with the previous speaker with olga in general, now there is a big
trend  on the automation of everyone on their knees, including
financial services, the next slide answers the question posed by the
profession in general, a financier, we can safely say that financiers and
specialists with knowledge of finance can work in different industries, ranging
from banking and somewhere to automation in IT information
companies  in companies, this profession will always be in demand; it changes
in response to what is happening in the world. financial specialists help

00:34
companies calculate rice and, by reducing the number of
costs, increase the payback of the product and,
most importantly, pay your losses at least to see what is in general.
means the profession of a financier at the
current moment, that is, that personnel
services are requesting in search of such a specialist, first of all,
our students would have to understand club bachelors of
magistracy who come to learn how to read financial statements how to
compile them know and analog accounting regulatory framework federal laws
relating to this area of also be able to have skills have skills
financial modeling i.e. predict business development

00:35
calculate different indicators possible risks identify know the office
program even better if a specialist knows how to program at least at a basic
level their data needs to be visualized somehow in order to see the dynamics and
react in time, the business reacted to certain
situations that occur in business, as well as
financiers who are involved in this direction in general, in principle, should
have great erudition in the field of economics to know the
specifics of the business with which it works, that is, the market
and in general how the business works, all the schemes,
and our financial services always understand very thoroughly the

00:36
details of the business, that is, financiers understand all attacked
no  business, in order to be able to communicate with different departments both
from a financial point of view and from a non-automation point of view, that is,
communication skills, initiative skills should be manifested by such
specialists, that is, such general general skills that, in general, are
typical for many, the next slide is now based on  trends that are
generally taking place in the world and in Russia, in general, four
directions for the development of this profession can be distinguished: this is a
financier economist analyst we have a manager and a financier engineer

00:37
here it is interesting that the line between them is very thin and
often there is a combination of such specialists, but as I said and
as Olga also said  that we have, but the
financial sector is very extensive, that is, you
have to delve into various different
details, for example, a financier economist, he analyzes financial indicators,
respectively, we must give such
knowledge to our listeners, that is, you know how to
analyze the financial indicators of the
market, evaluate the value of a company's financial instruments and assets,
predict I macro economically they show [music] and the
economist he develops a strategy since

00:38
these companies improve the furnace company the
analyst looks at various indicators
analyzes the risks of the father an interesting
direction of the financial engineer here is
this communication specialist here with our changes in information technology of
huge automation which is now happening financial engineer to design new
financial instruments and  products, that is, he analyzes financial markets,
trends, looks for some optimal sources of financing for corporations, and
in general, financial markets have recently undergone huge car  dynamic
changes such new information financial technologies as
blockchain crowd finca appeared and then electronic payments with all these
products i.e. the development of new similar
products is occupied by a financial engineer a financial manager analyzes this

00:39
risk the company needs to raise capital assesses the value of the
business organizes control over investments and
the financial manager takes part in the
preparation of the company's budget system
participates in the modeling of the financial
evaluation of the effectiveness of investment projects,
that is, the financier must keep pace with automation in step with the times and
here the next slide please now there is a huge transformation, including the
financial sector and, for example, according
to RBC development research  The financial
industry is heading in such directions as innovation in digital currencies i.e.

00:40
blockchain technology is causing a number of huge changes aimed at the aaa
space i.e. over the past b  the number of transactions
related to cryptocurrency will noticeably increase, we are forming some such
credit card platforms as an additional incentive , another direction is without
contact, that is, according to the central bank, for example, in
2023, the turnover of cash and will decrease a big push to
abandon real money cinnamon go to remotely change  your childish experience of
communication with the requirements [music] very service me it's only me or

00:41
echo probably only you sometimes interrupting understandable maybe
she can please you list technology finn read and agree
two words students here's what you what you in them but maybe that  -somehow
unexpectedly or vice versa once you
communicate with students what you need to know about our students
well what you need to know about our students our students still lack
basic no skills exactly financial
instruments people often come to the registry ben

00:42
add that master of education yes yes Yes yes, we start from the base,
how it is built, how to analyze it [music] and
financial indicators in general, that is, in my opinion, undergraduate students
in the master's program are not enough well [music]
all all the guys are always proactive, they work very well at lectures and at

00:43
seminars, that is, now  a portrait of a modern student is very, very put
everyone is interested in his knowledge, they work out completely all the tasks
that are set for them, that is , they work, you can say students who
would be interested in us presentation of trends and our current

00:44
understanding of what students know and should learn
thank you very much I would like to pass the
floor to Irina the same to be honest several times I didn’t really
shudder, but noted for myself the
speeches of previous colleagues references to the study of
large consulting companies  derov information, irina just represents such a
major player in the market of the acc steam company, this is accenture
accenture in russia, besides this company, accenture is a

00:45
strategic and long-term partner of the company; visits to offsite events and
the question itself is rather not the same as
for the rest yes how do you see the digitalization of the financial function
have you seen live digital financial directors
what they are now what they will be in the future and what we can give students
yes thank you very much knees really really  interesting questions, and
julia, I can ask you, in fact, all the largest companies here in
russia all over the world have long and persistently
moved towards the fact that finances become digital and the
role of the safe, which, well, probably,
will also be important for students from such a financier who is rather
close to an accountant. there counter  they are olating

00:46
who, at the reporting date, prepares a report,
shows yes, there are some indicators, let’s say, of the past, yes,
moves towards the fact that the CFO becomes a business partner,
becomes a strategic one and your cheese for business allows business to
make certain decisions and the gap between traditional finances  if you
look at the slide in the left corner and call it a legend file from this is what
in fact all the large corporations are already
moving towards and here Russia is everywhere in the world
it is huge and it is here that when possessing prior construction and digital
finance this is what we call intelligence files the ability to make informed
decisions quickly arises much faster that's what
you can work on in order to build digital finance here on this slide there

00:47
are several let's say even a few parameters on which the
organization of work is up to 1 frame and yes, what is called the body of the
hay state and here are other colleagues too
they talked about it yes that is a fact  Technically, the
financial service now consists not only of financiers and accountants,
here we need specialists predictive analysts dat ass on this you are modelers,
that is, those who know how to build predictive models who know how to evaluate
business cases and give business advice, for example, a folder not to invest
in a particular project, that is  Let's just say that the
interest for the same applicants is that what the
financial service does is much wider than what is much wider than accounting is
much wider than reporting, this is natural,
but the analysis of what business goes to and what it does
naturally is the appropriate discipline, these are the appropriate

00:48
appropriate roles and the study of relevant data
materials, as for  well, yes, of course, digital financially based on data is
clear to everyone, and it is data and the construction of data that work with
this data allows us to make such decisions, give business advice, and
so on, all this naturally allows us to do technology, yes, it eats  if
traditional financial systems are based on
some kind of legacy systems on traditional patience systems, then now
aromatization is also used, even
yesterday robotization is used when robots are used to
release lists of routine steps and locate people for more complex tasks,
not routine yes, this is the use of artificial intelligence  and machine
learning is just the same for compiling effective models, this

00:49
is really ready, what a colleague said cryptocurrencies quantum
technologies, etc. as for the process of
building the organizational structure of the financial function, if earlier in
traditional finance there were so -called wells, now finance is
much closer business courts use candle approaches when all
different departments work in one common team in order to
quickly  make decisions faster to give business results, that’s all these
areas, in fact, yes, this is what applicants should study in order to
have a full range of skills and yes, in order to work in a modern

00:50
digital financial service, but probably like this, in short, a great way to
it seems to me that for our students, take some square and
then look at which next step you will go to, each step will be progress in work,
work and career, I will add that most companies do this,
and in particular from 8 capital to which in any 0 and quite a lot
invested  efforts in building data warehouses in building all the
tools so that you can make informed decisions as well
as all the key players in the market, so let's say where to apply this
knowledge it is absolutely definitely there in this demand the need is what
all the largest clients are working on in our market I will

00:51
perfectly cover a beautiful excellent prospect for tr
I want to give the floor to the representative of investors to the
representative of the bank if peter is with us peter I’m here yes how do you
manage to get out of the black square of the black square for a
long time yes now not black excellent
petr dorozhkin representative of vtb bank a man with a
long and  productive careers within the financial sector, but besides this
, a person who comes to the audience communicates with students

00:52
teaches at a Russian economic school and knows, knows [music]
the needs of students, not only in ours in ours but also in others in
other universities besides this  I asked Peter to tell me, but
from the perspective of digitalization from the side of the investor and from the
side of the bank, and I again have the same question of
how to learn this what is happening in the
financial sector in terms of digitalization
and the second question is how to learn this thank you Eugene thank you for
inviting me to this event, let me first  I will briefly introduce
myself  it would be clear what I'm going to talk about
my name is petr paths in the vtb group i am responsible with long-term financial

00:53
planning for what western banks would call finance strategies, that is, for the
formation of long-term financial goals of the
organization with this sight so that they justify the goals set by the
shareholders  which put the regulator so on,
besides the fact that I work in finance, I work in one of the most, let's
say, those intensive areas in the finger divisions of the turkey
before separation, which do not just work with
friends in the digitalization of information technology more often, namely,
probably with knowledge-intensive and part  lessons
imagine when it comes to planning a bank in any company then as a rule
highlights short-term planning long-term planning
what you need we need a budget he can business plan in this case usually

00:54
people have food very process intensive very process intensive
process such a pun  then eats you just need to have
business partners, business or numbers in
the stem system, everything neatly folded, calculated, consolidated, we got the
result in my case, everything is more difficult
because you can take into account a lot of factors how the
economy will develop how the banking system will develop
how to maximize return on capital if necessary how to compare
algorithms and techniques here down the bottom-up which is used in forecasting
this is the context of the visit what I do of course I take interns every year
almost every you replenish the team, that is,
they have the opportunity to communicate with the hammer to the

00:55
young rising generation in view of this, I answer  questions who would
build an answer as follows, saying digitalization, let's first
think a little bit about the context that the
game is happening outside the window and
how we can act with what is happening outside the window as
a whole, and what is happening outside the window is the
following, I will be a little more specific, we have our own ball  So
I’ll try, I’ll try, I’ll try, they’ll try to talk
in the first place in the light of the events that are happening in our world
, companies are shortening the planning horizon, that is, if earlier
companies talked more about strategy about what
will happen in five years in 10-15 now they are talking about what will happen
next  year on the one hand to the truth on because the goal is to
survive this year how to live this year on the other hand, there is

00:56
still a great risk that we will lose the long-term goal and
having taken some actions during this year, having chosen the right path
or adjusting the minimum union,
we will not be able to adjust later  to speak on the right trajectory, the
first second trend that is now present is, unfortunately, or parts of
import substitution, how is it what kind of impact does pineapple
have, we have certain software products west of them, these
program laws, products must somehow not
just be replaced unfortunately, we are now
refusing situations when we  forced to
maneuver between the functionality of convenient
Western products and familiarity, let’s
say with the system implemented there and, let’s say, certain features of
domestic products that are still not mature enough at some points,

00:57
and of course, an important trend, an important detail, the context is the
budget, given that it won’t be possible to earn much this year
at least  As far as banks have a budget and cut
that this is what, as a rule, customers who allocate investor money they want
from those small investments that cannot do anything from that porridge or
from those activated their expenses
to get the maximum, unfortunately, the cost of
automation is not digitalization of the financial
department here  can hardly be attributed because they have a long horizon a
long payback horizon what follows from this context what
difficulties they have what trends we have in the framework of the
digitalization of the financial function at least I do not see the

00:58
number one difficulty planning how long-term it is
short-term activision with  working with colleagues it becomes more complicated
before we had conditionally 5 counterparties
now we have about ten counterparties everyone wants their own cut everyone wants
their own word of this model the number of outs that this model
has it also grows that is earlier if you set all the strategic goals you
wanted all the implementation of the detailing just a
multiplier on the target profit for now you need June because  but Mecca and
some of the g parameters of their scenario magician,
that is, calculate for us and for several options what will happen if and to be
if and what will happen if this all imposes certain
requirements since childhood on those software products those requirements for
civilization that  which we share, of

00:59
course, of course, they are naturally complicated by the financial director, he
significantly develops, the functionality increases, he moves absolutely
correctly yes, that is, earlier on top of the
account, now it is also himself and the main person for information security,
which is not what it means that
when more is added within the financial department one digital product, it is
forced to integrate with a much larger number of systems and
this leads to an increase in financial costs,
and you are just a single person and increases the risk of errors
with this very integration, which
is important the very previous paragraph about the fact that
now it is very difficult to prove that
investments  at the pace they are somehow  - something at least

01:00
somehow extremely well, in general, I would say that there is the
following problem now within the country and within
business very much attention to the field of information technology they say
that predators 2 oil is probably true but let's not forget about what
to go  the bed itself, it cannot work without a customer, and here, between the
customer, us as a customer and as performers, there is a certain
vector and a gap, these are people who,
on the one hand, need to know the financial aspects of the
other side, know the IT aspects , unfortunately, in this area now there are
certain  lack of personnel, partly these personnel left, partial these
personnel were for the rights of men and were promoted and,

01:01
let's say, they may not be completely managed with work as well as we
would like, and here there is a potential for those students
who are graduating tomorrow into this niche to fill that  such students need to
know so that they can take their course successfully about social security.
well, first of all, as I said, understanding both financial somehow and
technical aspects of the principle of work, where, secondly, this is probably a
good mathematical base, whatever one may say
, I have a first technical education and within the framework of
one of the projects that we did, we did not  more less a multidimensional
financial model is such a step forward over excel when
you apply a model of a two-dimensional table in
multidimensionally, this base is very necessary in order

01:02
to put a tz-type recession base under the tasks that we set as downloads and
which predators must understand,
you need to understand  the basics of the operation of algorithms, for example,
such an example of a dilemma in france modeling is separable complexity times
transparency and from a practical point of view, of course
, more practice is needed, that is, conditionally more people from faster who
speak at least like me as speakers in the
classroom in order for students to have siding, they have such  let's
say  m of what is happening here now,
but not in the classroom, but in the office what tasks are set by customers like

01:03
these customers pain what tasks they set how they are implemented
we of course probably have more practice with
all sorts of different computational tasks mathematical
I would say the level is much higher than we goals 11 here  that is, if we look
there also a trainee in ourselves that, let's say, in the
movies, they even amg things to the ball, yes, that
is, we don’t even ask people, we think that we can stand it very well,
be able to program, so, if briefly, then the answer to the question is still
Peter  thank you very much for such a comprehensive view and valuable ideas, to
be honest, it’s a little sobering that the
financial department is low on financial initiatives, and that these

01:04
initiatives are actually low margin, long payback, it’s low, I may be a little
wrong said very hard to prove that this is really old  high just
imagine that in order to highlight the day  gi in reality you need
to go through three or four committees and in
each of these committees you need to provide something and
they called it to represent everyone in different ways but how do we
do a lot for one thing your big competition
here you have roughly the boundaries of otiev
business which  clear to schools and
clearly the shield of the world, and here you come
to tell him how it would be, let's automate planning how much it will
save people, on the contrary, there will be more people how much
money you can save on this, yes, on the contrary,
investment in software products will be

01:05
required, and in what  then it makes sense
to do it anyway, it’s necessary to do it equally,
yes, but we’ll kind of get away from the
taxil’s stone ax and move on to some kind of
industrial system, we’ll reach the world level, excellent, what’s the
point of proving that three bag-ends are of course complex, such as
once and I want to say that what is possible not for when knowing how hard it is
in large companies and  how many times do you need
to lay your head down so that you cut it off,
it’s better not to stick it there right away, but I’m
because these committees, yes, of course, they are hard to explain
Peter, you can also have a question about a swarm from an intern and
here are young employees through at what point in time or through what tests

01:06
or  what kind of transformation of a young employee this return from a new
specialist becomes positive what should happen, it’s just the passage of
time or some kind of significant events when a specialist becomes useful and
brings added value positive good question I would say one of the
important stages when a person can become a
slave  one of the important stages comes that
person gets the opportunity to work independently
does not distract my time and the time of the mars of experienced people,
let's say it happens for myself, it happens in different ways,
I would say that probably a person goes to independent work tramer in a year is

01:07
excellent, in general, two years in  master's degree and one
from these years should already begin with
practice so that already at the exit from the
magistracy to give a positive effect for the employer to a
good before after the first entry of the
magistracy, the exit for an internship and,
accordingly, with a diploma, a person can already get a promotion to become a
full-fledged employee with a poor experience and are ready to replenish
it, thank you very much for your  the comment for us is very valuable for us to
build a training plan for our students, I want to give the floor to oleg
nazarov, who also joined our discussion oleg is
a financial market professional with a proven work history worked

01:08
in a management company the other part of the spectrum of
companies is an entrepreneur and
founder of a start-up in the field of fitness and fitness industry Oleg,
taking into account such a broad outlook, how
do you see the digitalization of finance among big players and perhaps not so
big ones and what should students do  Thanks to the entam, in fact,
somehow returning to past experience, I can
say, well, it’s clear that listening to everything that is
being condemned here today, it’s clear that the
financial function of seafight is a very
conservative function and and and role, and therefore, as Irina said, as if in
large companies, there is a gulf between traditional finance and  where it’s

01:09
all important to come sometime she’s big with this I completely agree that
on the other side in extremes in small business
digital finance or numbers and sculpted the
digital function of finance is a daily
necessity this is something without which, in principle, it is
almost impossible to live firstly because that small companies small businesses
simply do not have the money to hire from above
more often all the functions of the safe are connected
within one person the functions are related to the
business associated with attracting
investments the spread associated with advertising
with sales with the product and it is forced to connect here
with one from one end  with what is called accounting and cou  nting
management accounting financial planning and so on with what

01:10
is at the other end i.e. with the result with sales with revenue with
all this in this sense they are not separated they are in the same
head at the extreme in two if there are two partners or in 3 if  there is also a
partner for most often a financial director or the function of a
financial director in a small business, a function that is very close to the
financial result in terms of revenue or profit or sales, and
in order for it to work, you first need to buy it if possible or
outsource it or install it yourself  -solutions that will help
to replace traditional financial functions in some way without spending too
much time, therefore, relatively speaking, now there are most banks for the
self-employed there is always the opportunity to
calculate their taxes to pay them don’t do it with your own hands

01:11
, I can also say that by my own example if finances if if person in
charge of finance  Ansy does not see how
revenue is generated based on the results of
an advertising campaign does not understand how the company receives money
at all as a result of expenses spent on advertising
, well, this most often does not work now it can be done now
all advertising is most of the advertising is advertising in social networks and
this advertisement is a shield abundantly and when I, as a
financial director, call my company, I
discuss with the guys what kind of advertisement
to launch, then I look at advertisements not as
no cost that we have to spend and then maybe we will get something, but as a
set of parameters that will lead to a certain result
they do it only due to the fact that all these

01:12
numbers, all these parameters, all these even
boards, we have the presence in this sense,
we don’t have any legacy as a small business and
it lives as if cutting corners as much as possible, Peter said that
you need to go through several layouts  to
convince people that what is needed is something to endorse the figure
so it is clear that in small  in business there is no
time for a committee there is no time to
change the legacy simply because of these
stereotypes and the capable type, I mean just the usual pre-revolutionary
methods for solving
financial problems, they are simply not there, you just need to do
it here and now in some way to spend money on
sales, we  we knew exactly how much we would get from them
and for this we use all the possibilities that exist on the market

01:13
we we use stripe as a budgeting system for financial
planning systems I simplify this on purpose, however I use we use all kinds of
connect and to programs sold there that
allows  we immediately understand after we spent this money and we will most
likely get y than to do it in real time and
understanding, as it were, that every dollar spent by
a yuan football player will lead to some kind of revenue
in a day, two days later, you can ask alik well, and some so to
say that  in small companies, then such startups are very dynamic  a temporary
financial function, it partially dissolves in other functions, I can
say that, yes, venture companies in startups, small businesses,

01:14
financial functions, the financial director as a function cannot afford to
be as close as possible to the business, so network developers can afford not to
understand finance, on the
contrary, for years, but on the contrary, no  well, simply
because then nothing will happen and in this sense, how if you answer
question 2 that you have is that how to learn all this I can say
my own experience I have never been a siphon I worked a lot for sifu of
large companies but when I  became an
entrepreneur, then I realized that in order to be able to connect
the financial function with business and
there with development, because development is
an integral part of the whole picture, you need to be a product manager, so
as you and I discussed, this is what would be nice, let's
teach students this  product management which connects  as a

01:15
matter of fact IT business and finance you may not be an expert enter
such as this developer you may not be an expert in
business in marketing the one who is an advertising specialist
you may not even be a very deep specialist in accounting
someone must understand  all this in order to be able to
combine this on the first of May to own the work
and release the product in order to give the product so that it enters the
market so that you start buying so that it's all somewhere 2 gross and the
second moment is important too  that the
financial director or there the financial function should get used to taking
risks I started by saying that she is very
conservative initially the traditional
financial director herself is a conservative what this
series of commissions and committees is

01:16
trying to avoid they are trying to avoid risk yes but we are now
talking about how to teach  people who must at this moment
adapt this system  the topic to turn it into a more mobile pain figure drawn
they must learn to take risks because well, as if business is always
an attempt to get somewhere, it can end in failure and for any traditional CFO
any failure is a loss that needs to be
written off that needs to be explained to the
committee and shareholders  and so on and
if you are a digital financial director you
just understand that this is an inevitable
part of life here now it is to be blamed
to accept this is a very complicated story this is an
old man Andreeva's appearance equals
venture turns out to be autocad in fact this is exactly how this story
begins with if I'm sorry if
if  I’m over forty, it’s very difficult to learn to understand
risks, because I was taught all the way how to avoid them

01:17
, but if you’re 20, then there’s still
a great chance to learn this, well, this
subject can be called whatever you like given
this entrepreneurship in fact yes, a very important component  for us too much
visible  that is, at the undergraduate level, and by the way, the
propensity for risk and entrepreneurship
in management programs, for example, and in
economics programs, these economics programs are attended by more people with an
analytical warehouse and tend to work in such a more secure
environment, such regulated large companies and those who go to management to
those  who want to go on but create their own business to go into
entrepreneurship and we, as a university, as a
university, want to give people the opportunity
to develop, and with those and other preferences, and
most importantly, that they find each other and
know how to work with each other, I think it was for us  would be a very good

01:18
result for us and for our students, thank you very much
for wanting to just add the last drop to these subjects that would be
properly studied not a subject, probably, but you just need to just show more
business cases, you need to go beyond large companies in
order to broaden your horizons a little because only that  well, it
starts with the beginning of the very digitalization that
big companies will think in their mouths for a long time
simply because it’s a big legacy and needs to be changed a lot,
yes, but maybe a big legacy can be a big buyer for a small
startup with a big assessment, but not now,
really, due to different circumstances  but in the
future, but once thanks, big oleg wanted to give the floor to alexey kalashnikov

01:19
alexey you are with us good evening colleagues
alexey the current financial director finally we got to how to say
really a person from the industry a
person because of the difficult industry and for close friendly geography alexey
works for the multi-profile holding orient uzbekistan and is developing the
development of different segments of this
business alexey how can you make sure the
digitalization of the financial function

01:20
socialization doesn’t happen not only in
russia, it happens in their countries next to russia, oddly enough,
socialization is such a buzzword now,
although it seems to me that this is one of the
tools, although speaking about numbers, the task makes sense separates
traditional and digital business now there are many
businesses that initially build themselves
as digital, that is, there are all processes
processes related to business, rather,
years have passed, they have already been digitized,
yes, that is, there is a figure, he and sales are
digitized there, purchases are digitized there, the value chain is digitized and
therefore the digitalization of processes it
entails  it is necessary to digitize the
accounting of accounting functions and all the functionality

01:21
that you own, you must own the financial director, that is, this
accounting and reporting planning and budgeting and controlling, and there
investment projects, that is, in digital in digital business,
without digitalization, there is no longer anywhere the
process is already digitized  If we we go aside in the traditional business of
tons, then it’s probably worth saying first of all that the
basis is important for the financial director, that is, for dad, firstly, the business
itself should already be quite mature, the
business process should be established again, the same
production, purchases, sales  from the point of view of finance
, a certain minimum should be created, that is, the
company should already be able to take into account planning budgeting,

01:22
calculate investment projects with its websites, and here, probably,
at the junction of a working business and a financially minimally created
direction of the financial block, a headlight appears  zation
as another tool, again
speaking about centralization, digitalization can be distinguished
as such an expanded accounting system, that is, the ability to quickly
receive information ayodhya to store and and
will be considered from different angles, and
then this is the first part and the second part is
still a civilization process  with that is,
digitalization of coordination digitalization of
budgeting digitalization of controlling, that is, those same traditional basic
basic functions that will take a lot of time, but still

01:23
on which reporting such improved reporting is faster more accurate
more segmented yes and the second is some also yes  yes definitely
and also more transparent more understandable cheaper and more
convenient because if I put one digit into the system once and I can copy the
digit from different angles and can I put in one reporting form in another I can
assume  that it will grow two times or three times that it will
shrink elites and speech and or something else, well,
that is, that is, I should not, firstly , the same data if we
are talking about digitalization as an accounting
system, I am not India  should transfer the same data from different systems to
different ones there, produce errors, and secondly, I

01:24
can, I can transparently for myself  I am both for and
for a circle earlier for investors for a hand
for guidance for colleagues from the right
departments I can show that we are like we are
where we are, well, that is, all the company’s activities are still
permeated with money , so what I often say to
colleagues and caused in general despite our  wonderful wonderful missions
that are especially loved by big companies we are here to make
money we are not here to produce equipment saying I don’t know
machines clothes or food we are here to earn money so
let’s measure all our wonderful initiatives in terms of how they help to make
money and how  since digitalization is a tool in my opinion,
and this is an important task of the financial director, it is still

01:25
helping to make money, it is possible for you to use efforts to
relocate capital to some other direction will bring much
more returns now it is necessary at this stage of life data in this company
can  we don’t know if we should train staff or hire staff,
maybe we should modify our equipment, or maybe we should
start digitalization of processes
because we will gain something from this something to gain time accuracy
cost reduction market market value because investors like
words words digitalization and the introduction of a
large beautiful dress and product increases the market value of the company
new new investors come to us we show our beautiful transparent

01:26
business that we see from any angle you want as you like so
we will cut it to you my city and see the business
and it  we are managing it, therefore
, after all, digitalization, in my opinion, this is a tool, in my opinion,
digitalization makes sense to deal with
when the business is mature enough, when in general
there is an understanding from the model, there are basic
basic functions, the functionality of the financial department already and
we should deal with the implementation to give birth for the sake of something
probably this  under the soup of civilization, yes, but
alexey to spin a real phone that you can’t say that everything happens
for the sake of the financial result and the

01:27
value of the company, thank you very much look,
but about the students that he was also a question, I would like to see that
he already has a student coming from the university  there is some
visibility I don’t know how to choose words correctly in Russian these
are the same cases the same tools as applied to different red companies
that what you see happens like this we can take something
works, maybe this is how we apply this tool here and with
us and with us it should also be beneficial, but it happens like this is a disk
where there is no financial department
but everything but everyone is imbued with ideas of
making money  but it happens somehow 1 then, of course, you want at least basic
programming skills, not even for a

01:28
person to come and with some  about a specific
language, but in order to have an understanding of how to
build algorithms, how to translate a physical process into a program language,
so I want something like this to explain something to a computer, there are
some, and that's it, programming gives an
understanding of an approach like this  you can do it and
then it greatly simplifies the task in
digitalization during formation, and so, of course, I
want students in the basic tools section to pay attention to what
financial statements are about what they are
with tools parameters coefficients of the model
how to analyze an investment project

01:29
in general why this is all  how they of course basis basis is
needed here is a programmer analytical state well at least here at least it is
to get a bank 3 components are so powerful I like a deacon take note
that our students should at least pass what happens in different
ways still another skill  learn skill skill get fight analyze information
because without this you can’t do without it
alexey plows thank you very much for the comment, I propose to end
our some official part with speeches and finally for those students

01:30
who stayed here, maybe you wanted to ask something, we
turned out to be very full of such a one and a half
hours more than we thought, so if you have any questions with the speaker
that we have left, then please, it 's time to ask and I know that among
our guests there is Andrey Karen check, who develops financial
services in the field of personal finance, maybe Andrey that  - I wanted to
add a general question to students not
current and in the future, do not hesitate to ask some question of your own, we
will be happy to answer and maybe
Andrey wanted to say something according to his impression, but from the side of

01:31
personal finance services, the area of centralization is also a good  veni
g  well, I didn’t listen to a very interesting
speech, of course, for all the skills that are listed necessary, the
necessary ones will always come in handy not only in finance,
but also in a simple life, specifically, even the top managers with
whom I communicate, for example, are now lost and cannot
determine how to act in the conditions of dynamically changing exchange rates
there, including for making their own
decisions, not only on a scale  businesses on the scale of managing their own

01:32
capital, in this regard, the use of effective there and
various tools and techniques,
including digital ones, especially digital ones, which
allow a long-term financial model or identify the most difficult
undefined places, including managing risks, they are actually in
demand more than ever now because  that more and more more the
environment in which we are at the moment it changes more more more uncertainty
and only tools for analysis of rapid modeling,
planning, assessment and risk management can, so to speak, lead

01:33
to  in a hurry, I would say so, but including not only in business and managing
cash flows or assets there, but also with my own financial well-being
up to 3 thanks, absolutely what is called I completely agree,
even now I would like to note such a moment that here are a
lot of specialties, a lot of plans I  reviewed the training and drew
attention to the fact that, for example, he sees personal
wealth management as very little attention, and for example, if in the
programs of Western universities there, let’s say career planning is an
integral part of personal wealth management, we have this item, but

01:34
somehow it is very missed and in fact  business,
for example, resume writing skills, it’s not at all where, it’s
never covered, or there are some, but
writing even when you already need to write a
resume when, yes, yes, that is, when
Andrei Novotorgovy is already laid down by a lack of
personal finance, it seems to me that this is another
kind of cultural barrier  there is that but I'm going to  and as if there is no
gate somehow to increase my net worth during my career and how to say I
do it somehow systematically and how to say
systematically, in my opinion it has not yet
taken root, well, the idea and it seems to me that this is a
drawback that we really need this do it and the earlier

01:35
you invest more in it how to say the result by the time of retirement how
really very important such moments there are things but really need
more thank you for showing and the numbers [music] sergey
I also want to talk to our guests if they are still in flocks

01:36
sergey anatolievich is love for some period of
about a year until now  maybe even less and does not see the return
on investments of digitalization a lot of finance function with
this you constantly encounter such a pain, probably many financiers
seem to need it all the time, but the drive in the
context of the year does not appear, so we put off the low priority and
everyone needs it, but the film is how to say the budget  the next year the
paradoxical situation of a milkmaid does not fall recently he
talked with a colleague he is also engaged in the
digitalization of the tariff area and when he
talks about the bird with none of the clients at all,
he asked him the question of what digitalization will give me in this direction,

01:37
he answered him accuracy at the rocks yes if if you would say the
cost of the economy, I would not talk to you further,
but the fact that the accuracy is increasing and I
chose such a vector for myself that it is precisely by avoiding some
mistakes, including accounting in budgeting, that
one can probably show the effectiveness of
digitalization of which  -the direction, if possible, I would also test 2
answers  this is flexibility and reliability, that
is, paralysis can go in different ways, one of them is existing
processes, we even more how to say give a lot of
automation this is one way and the other way is when we invest in
being able to reconfigure, including chasing some kind of crisis  period

01:38
to which we better understand the cost structure better understand where
our costs are formed and what brings more
money such flexibility and reliability in the
sense that mistakes may not be avoided, but we can avoid some kind of
repetition or something of mistakes, this is
how you think your owner or  here is your branch of flexibility reliability
that the direction is just for persuading managers, but here this is a question
that is not always possible to translate into a figure, that is, but only Peter
said how would I formulate this one for myself as ro and bag-end here is the
profitability the profitability of investments in  its how to say systems
that do not sell anything but provide life  the activity of the
enterprise is very difficult to calculate it is difficult to prove it is

01:39
interesting that we are the same here when big vyacheslav natalia
if you listened to the end you probably have something to say
confirm or deny something thanks doctor both of this [music]
I am glad that you could join and yes I  I was worried that we could
send him the wrong link, move a straight wide range of
opinions from the fact that one with this is the basis of the
basics to the fact that none of the happiness and
need to develop other systems for us are
very well useful, it seems to me a look and

01:40
there are colleagues with whom you can discuss
different directions, it seems to me that this is the
work that you are doing to participate in the competition in
teaching 1c, it just evokes a response and an important direction that requires
knowledge in order to create an alternative
system, you need to know how the existing one works [music]
I already understood that financial documentation should be compiled [  music]
let's go deeper and yes, it seems to me that the base of the base is
good and that's it  bring some of these
companies, including those for bachelor's programs, to some kind of but update
some courses with the participation of an

01:41
industrial partner, you are one of those companies present here is quite
real such a development of events you can try to ask things collect yes yes
try ask the numbers you search search Vyacheslav Repina,
did you listen to the end, do you want to say something, what kind of remark is
apparently not and Vladimir, it seems to me that we have achieved the goal of
our seminar, all those who were invited expressed a lot, how do you like your
impressions, how do you see our future work, first of all, of course, I
want to say a big thank you  to everyone who
came to us today, this is a very valuable

01:42
opinion, I noticed interesting things for myself
, now I’m working as part of the admission campaign of working with applicants
who come from the program, I noticed this trend, too, there is a
certain transformation transformation of the
request from students what was in the
past year before last  today they are already
students though  very attractive for them when I start to tell that the
program has a large number of experts, a large number of people who are
directly involved in business, a large number of cases, but for them this
is now a very important attractive moment, and for many it is the decision to
apply for our program after when you don’t hear that there is an
expert position here, that there are people here
who will tell you about the things that are
happening now in business, and that’s the
request that we heard today, it really

01:43
responds to students for them, it’s important,
today I saw that we are moving towards
each other, it’s great  I give it great that
the experts themselves and business representatives
say that we need students who have tried one, two, three things and already how
can they tell some independent position, it’s very cool,
we will be glad to see everyone on our programs within our disciplines
as guest speakers of the central spike  I
’m looking forward to the start of our program with such great enthusiasm,
I think that it will be something special, thank you very much for them, mutual
thanks to colleagues for participating, thanks to our guests, we are
waiting for applicants in our program  goodbye guests
